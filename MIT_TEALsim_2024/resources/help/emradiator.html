     	<h3>The EM Radiator is a simulation of how to generate plane electromagnetic  
                          waves by shaking a sheet of positive electric charge (the pink sheet). 
                          When the "Motion On" box is CHECKED,
                          the sheet is automatically shaken up and 
                          down sinsoidally.  When the "Motion On" box is UNCHECKED,
                          the user shakes the sheet up and down by left clicking on the silver ball and moving the mouse 
                          up and down.</h3>
                          <h3>The black line perpendicular to the pink sheet of charge represents a field line of the total electric field of the sheet
                          (the static field plus the radiation field).  The orange arrows represent the radiation electric
                          field (without the static field).  The blue arrows represent the radiation magnetic field.  </h3>
