<b>We have a magnet and a ring which are movable.  To move the magnet or ring, left 
click and drag on the one you want to move. 
The ring has a self-inductance and a resistance.  You can
change the magnetic dipole moment of the magnet and the resistance of the ring using the sliders to the right of the view window.      
		</p>
		
<p>
<b>The top graph to the right shows the external magnetic flux and the total magnetic flux.  The graph below shows 
the induced (eddy) current in the ring.  You can increase or decrease the number of field lines shown using the bottom slider.  
</p>  
<p>
<b>If you want to have the magnet move sinusoidally in and out of the ring automatically, select "Actions/Generator Mode".  
To return to user control, select "Actions/Manual Mode".
		</p>

		<p>
<b>The control buttons at the bottom of the view window have the properties indicated on the figure below.  When the 
application starts it is running.  To pause it use the button indicated.  To start it again use the start button.
