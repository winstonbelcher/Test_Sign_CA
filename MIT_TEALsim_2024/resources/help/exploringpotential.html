		<p><b>
You are the blue avatar and you are exploring the plane shown.  Where ever you are, your height above the plane
indicates the potential at that point in the plane.  THE ZERO OF POTENTIAL IS ARBITRARY AND CHANGES FROM ONE GAME TO THE NEXT, SO YOU CANNOT USE THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE
POTENTIAL IN YOUR GUESSES, ONLY CHANGES IN POTENTIAL.  The yellow arrow just below you or above you in the plane indicates the direction of the total electric field
in the plane at the point where you are.  You can choose whether this arrow indicates only the direction of the electric field, or whether it also gives you an indication of the strength of the field. 
</p>
<br>
<p><b>The electric field and potential are produced by two invisible point
charges somewhere in the plane shown, both with the same magnitude of charge, but either both are positive, 
both are negative, or one is negative and one is positive, with equal probability.  Your job is to walk around the plane, as explained below, exploring the
potential, until you figure out what the charges of the two invisible charges are.  

		</p>
		<br>
<p><b>You can move to explore the potential using the keypad on the top right, taking note that the numbers in the 3D scene
correspond to the numbers on the keypad.  That is, if you want to move toward the number "2" in the scene press the "2" keypad button.  
</p>
<br>
<p><b>
Once you think you know what the charges are that produce this potential see if your guess is correct by clicking in the appropriate radio button next to your guess.  If you 
wrong you will be penalized a certain number of points.  The object of the game is to find out the charges with the smallest number of moves.  	AFTER YOU HAVE PLAYED FOUR 
OR MORE GAMES YOU WILL SEE YOUR ENCRYPTED 
SCORE OVER THE LAST FOUR GAMES DISPLAYED IN THE TEXT BOX.  Copy and paste the entire sequence in the survey box if you are entering the contest.  If you want to better
your score keep playing.  The encrypted score for the last four games comes up each time you play a new game.  
</p>
<br>
<p><b>If you left click and drag in the scene you can change the view angle.  Each move increases your score by one point unless you have already visited the square you are
moving onto, IN WHICH CASE THERE IS NO INCREMENT IN SCORE.  </p>
