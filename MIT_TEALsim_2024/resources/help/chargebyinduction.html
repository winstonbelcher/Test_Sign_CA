	<p>
This application illustrates the "charging of objects by electrostatic induction" part of Experiment 2 in 8.02.  The experiment begins with the Faraday Ice Pail
(the inner wire mesh in your experiment) isolated and over all neutral, and the shield (the outer wire mesh in your experiment) 
connected to ground.  A central charge is introduced into the region of space interior to the Faraday Ice Pail by placing your "charge producer" 
in this region, <b> without touching </b>the ice pail (orange is positive, blue is negative).  
		</p>
<p>
When you begin execution by pressing the <i>Start</i> button, the charges in the Faraday Ice Pail respond 
appropriately depending on 
whether they are repelled or attracted to the central charge.  Because the shield is grounded, charge is also pulled in from infinity with a
sign that is appropriate to maintaining zero electric field between the shield and infinity.
</p>
<p>
You can control whether the Faraday Ice Pail and Shield are connected by a conductor or not.  You do this in the experiment 
by touching both with your hand simultaneously.  You do it in the simulation by pressing the appropriage buttons in the right control panel.  
</p>

<p>
Explore the sequence of actions that you take to leave the Faraday Ice Pail with a net charge on it without ever having touched the pail with 
your charge producer.  This is the process of charging by induction.
