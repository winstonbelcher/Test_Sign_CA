<b>You are the blue avatar and you are exploring the xy plane shown,as outlined by the white square.  Where ever you are, your height z above the plane
indicates the potential at that point in the xy plane.  THE ZERO OF POTENTIAL IS ARBITRARY AND CHANGES FROM CHARGE CONFIGURATION TO THE NEXT.  The yellow arrow just below you or above your avatar in the xy plane gives a measure of the total electric field
in the plane at the point where you are.  </p><br>

<p><b>The electric field and potential are produced by two point
charges in the xy plane as shown by the colored balls (orange positive, blue negative).  The charges always have the same magnitude of charge, but either both are positive, 
both are negative, or one is negative and one is positive, and you can chose which.  Your job is to walk around the plane, as explained below, exploring the
potential landscape, and trying to understand how the potential and the electric field are related for given signs and locations of the two charges.  You can change the
location of the two charges using the sliders on the right.   

		</p><br>
<p><b>You can move you avatar to explore the potential using the keypad on the top right, taking note that the numbers in the 3D scene
correspond to the numbers on the keypad.  That is, if you want to move toward the number "3" in the scene press the "3" keypad button.

<p><b>If you left click and drag in the scene you can change the view angle. </p>
