<p>
<b>This is a simulation illustrating Ampere's Law for a slab of current with current flowing out of the page.  The slab of current has a vertical height shown by the red rectangle in the view.  
The current is uniformly distributed over this slab.  The slab is infinite in the direction out of the screen and also horizontally.  
</p>

<p>
<b>You can chose either an imaginary rectangular Amperean loop or an imaginary circular Amperean loop using the control panel on the right.  The figure below shows the 
Amperean rectangle (gray).  </p>

</p>

<b>The line elements dl for the rectangle are shown by gray arrows.  The magnetic fields B at the line elements dl 
are shown by the blue arrows.  This is the field due to the slab of current.  You can change the vertical position of the Amperean loops using the 
slider in the right panel.  
</p>


<p>
<b>If you left click
and drag in the view, your perspective will change so that you can see the field vector and dl orientation better.  If you want to return
to the  original view hit the "Reset View" button in the Control Panel</p>
