     	<h3>This application is a simulation of how to generate electromagnetic  
                          waves by shaking an electric point charge. 
                          When the "Motion On" box is CHECKED,
                          the charge is automatically moved in one of four different patterns.   When the "Motion On" box is UNCHECKED,
                          the user shakes the charge by left clicking on the charge and moving the mouse in any arbitrary motion.</h3>
                          <h3>Note that this simulation assumes the motion is non-relativistic, and for that to be true you must move the mouse 
                          <i>slowly</i> compared to the propagation speed of the signal.  But there is no prohibition built into the program to
                          keep you from moving the charge faster than the speed of light if you desire.  In such a case you will see all sorts of non-physical field lines, e.g. field lines that
                          cross, and so on.   </h3>
