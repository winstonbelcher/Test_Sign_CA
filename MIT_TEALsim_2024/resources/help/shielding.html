	 <h2>This java simulation shows the 
	 electric field due to a free charge near an isolated conducting spherical shell with zero charge.  The free
	 charge can be inside or outside the shell.  Use the sliders under "Control Position of Free Charge" to set the
	 free charge position.  </h2>
	 <h2>We also show the charges induced on the surfaces of the shell by the presence of the point charge. 
	 These induced charges are such that they 
	 keep the electric field in the conductor zero.  </h2>
	 <h2>We give the user a choice between showing the total field
	 (that is the field due to the free charge and the induced charges), or the field due to the free charge alone, or the
	 charge due to the induced charges alone. </h2>
	<h2>This display gives you an idea of how the induced charges arrange themselves so as to keep the field in the conducing shell zero. </h2>
