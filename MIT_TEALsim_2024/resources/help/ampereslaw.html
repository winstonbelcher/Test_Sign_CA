<p>
<b>A simulation illustrating Ampere's Law for a circular or rectangular imaginary Amperean open surface, in the presence 
of unit line currents either out of the page or into the page.  You begin with one line current out of the page and one line current into the page.  
You can add additional line currents using the Control Panel, or delete all line currents present
and start again.
</p>

<p>
<b>The line currents can be moved around by left clicking and dragging on the line current.  You can select multiple line currents to move about by "ctrl left clicking" on successive line currents.  
</p>


<p >
<b>You can use the radio buttons on the Control Panel to choose whether your imaginary open Amperean surface is a 
cylinder or a sphere.  
You can move your Amperean surface around and by using the sliders in the Control Panel.  You will see tangents to the 
Amperean contour (gray arrows) at many points
on the contour defining the open surface (see figure).  At those same points you will see the local magnetic 
field on the contour due to all the line currents in the scene.  </p>

<p>
<b>If you left click
and drag in the view, your perspective will change so that you can see the field vector and tangent orientation better.  If you want to return
to the  original view hit the "Reset View" button in the Control Panel</p>
